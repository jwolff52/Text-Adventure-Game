# Choose Your Own Adventure
## A text based CYOA game because why not

## What is this
Well that is simple, it is a text adventure game created using Java with a terminal-esque user interface.

## Contributing
To contribute to the project [fork the repository](https://github.com/jwolff52/text-adventure-game/tree/development#fork-destination-box) and create a new branch titled with what you are adding/fixing (e.g. villager-api-fix). Make sure you only commit code relative to that bug inside of the branch or your PR will be rejected. Once you have written all of the code you will need to open up a pull request against the **Development** branch. Your changes will be reviewed and merged if they are approved!

### Note about testing the project
Currently the only way to run the project without compiling and without getting any errors is to comment out line 24 in `ChooseYourOwnAdventure.java` and line 36 in `SaveUtil.java`. If you create your branch from development (as you should) they should already be commented out but that is a good place to start if you have issues running the game.
